# Optimized-Class-Timetable-Generator
Intelligent Scheduling for Smarter Campuses


# 🧩 The Problem
Most colleges still rely on manual or spreadsheet-based timetable creation, leading to:
Class clashes and faculty overload


Underutilized classrooms and labs


Uneven workload distribution


Frustrated students and faculty


With NEP 2020 promoting flexible and multidisciplinary learning, scheduling complexity has exploded — existing tools can’t keep up.

# 💡 The Idea
An AI-powered, web-based platform that automatically generates optimized timetables for colleges by balancing:
Room utilization


Faculty workload


Student preferences


Fixed and elective slots


All while ensuring zero clashes and maximum efficiency.

# ⚙️ How It Works
Admins / HODs input:


Faculty, subjects, rooms, and constraints


Algorithm runs optimization (via Google OR-Tools / heuristic logic)


The system produces multiple optimized timetables ranked by efficiency


Users can review, tweak, and approve the final schedule


Exports available in PDF, CSV, or iCal for easy sharing



# 🧠 Tech Stack
Frontend: React (TypeScript)
 Backend: Node.js (Express)
 Database: MySQL with Prisma ORM
 Optimizer Engine: Python microservice using Google OR-Tools (CP-SAT)
 Hosting: Dockerized on AWS / Render

# 🌟 Key Features
🧑‍🏫 Faculty load & availability management


🏫 Classroom and lab capacity optimization


📅 Multi-department & multi-shift scheduling


⚖️ Automated conflict detection & rearrangement suggestions


🧮 Analytics dashboard for utilization insights


🔐 Role-based login and approval workflow



# 🚀 Impact
Saves 80% time vs manual scheduling


Increases classroom utilization by 20–30%


Eliminates faculty & room clashes


Improves satisfaction among faculty and students


Scalable for any university structure or NEP 2020-based curriculum



# 🔮 Future Scope
Student elective integration

Mobile app for personalized timetables


Integration with LMS platforms



# 🧭 Vision
To make academic scheduling smart, conflict-free, and adaptive —
 helping institutions focus less on logistics and more on learning outcomes.
