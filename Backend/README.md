# Optimized-Class-Timetable-Generator
Intelligent Scheduling for Smarter Campuses


# 🧩 The Problem
Most colleges still rely on manual or spreadsheet-based timetable creation, leading to:
Class clashes and faculty overload


Underutilized classrooms and labs


Uneven workload distribution


Frustrated students and faculty


With NEP 2020 promoting flexible and multidisciplinary learning, scheduling complexity has exploded — existing tools can’t keep up.

# 💡 The Idea
An AI-powered, web-based platform that automatically generates optimized timetables for colleges by balancing:
Room utilization


Faculty workload


Student preferences


Fixed and elective slots


All while ensuring zero clashes and maximum efficiency.

# ⚙️ How It Works
Admins / HODs input:


Faculty, subjects, rooms, and constraints


Algorithm runs optimization (via Google OR-Tools / heuristic logic)


The system produces multiple optimized timetables ranked by efficiency


Users can review, tweak, and approve the final schedule


Exports available in PDF, CSV, or iCal for easy sharing



# 🧠 Tech Stack
Frontend: React (TypeScript)
 Backend: Node.js (Express)
 Database: MySQL with Prisma ORM
 Optimizer Engine: Python microservice using Google OR-Tools (CP-SAT)
 Hosting: Dockerized on AWS / Render

# 🔐 Login & Signup System (How it Works)
The backend handles who is allowed to enter the system.

### How we check users:
1. **Signup**: When a user signs up, we save their **Email** and **Password** safely in our database.
2. **Login**: When a user tries to log in, we check if their **Email** and **Password** match what we have.
   - If it matches -> **Access Granted!** ✅
   - If it is wrong -> **Access Denied!** ❌

We use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** to give users a "digital pass" so they stay logged in while using the app.

# 🌟 Key Features
🧑‍🏫 Faculty load & availability management


🏫 Classroom and lab capacity optimization


📅 Multi-department & multi-shift scheduling


⚖️ Automated conflict detection & rearrangement suggestions


🧮 Analytics dashboard for utilization insights


🔐 Role-based login and approval workflow



# 🚀 Impact
Saves 80% time vs manual scheduling


Increases classroom utilization by 20–30%

Mobile app for personalized timetables


Integration with LMS platforms



# 🧭 Vision
To make academic scheduling smart, conflict-free, and adaptive —
 helping institutions focus less on logistics and more on learning outcomes.

# University Timetable Database Schema 


# 🏫 1. Department Model

### **Purpose**

Represents an academic department (like CSE, ECE, MECH, etc.) — acts as the core organizational unit.

### **Key Fields**

* **name** → Full department name (e.g., `"Computer Science and Engineering"`)
* **code** → Short code (e.g., `"CSE"`)
* **headOfDepartment** → Name or ID of HOD
* **totalFaculty**, **totalStudents** → Department stats
* **createdAt**, **updatedAt** → Record tracking timestamps

### **Relations**

* **faculties** → All faculty members in this department
* **classrooms** → Classrooms assigned to this department
* **subjects** → Subjects offered by the department
* **timetableSlots** → Slots scheduled under this department
* **authorizedUsers** → Admins/HODs tied to this department

💡 **Use:** You’ll use this as a central reference when generating department-wise timetables, faculty loads, and subject allocations.

---

# 👨‍🏫 2. Faculty Model

### **Purpose**

Represents a faculty member and their workload preferences.

### **Key Fields**

* **name**, **email**, **phone**
* **maxWeeklyLoad** → Maximum teaching hours per week
* **averageLeavesPerMonth** → To optimize schedules
* **availableDays** → JSON array (e.g., `["Monday", "Wednesday"]`)
* **preferredSlots** → JSON array of preferred time windows
* **departmentId** → FK → Department

### **Relations**

* **subjects** → Links through *SubjectFaculty* (many-to-many)
* **timetableSlots** → Timetable slots assigned to this faculty

💡 **Use:** Helps scheduler respect teacher availability, avoid overload, and balance lectures across week.

---

# 🏫 3. Classroom Model

### **Purpose**

Represents a specific classroom or lab space.

### **Key Fields**

* **name** → Classroom name (e.g., `"CSE-Lab-1"`)
* **year**, **semester** → Batch/semester it belongs to
* **departmentId** → FK → Department

### **Relations**

* **department** → Linked department
* **students** → Students in this classroom
* **timetableSlots** → Slots conducted in this room

💡 **Use:** Prevents double-booking and helps allocate suitable rooms (e.g., labs for practicals).

---

# 👨‍🎓 4. Student Model

### **Purpose**

Represents each student.

### **Key Fields**

* **name**, **rollNumber**, **email**, **phone**
* **classroomId** → FK → Classroom
* **attendancePercentage**, **enrollmentYear**

### **Relations**

* **classroom** → The class the student belongs to
